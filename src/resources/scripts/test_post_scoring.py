Over the past few years, I've realized how deeply motivated I am by mission-driven work‚Äîespecially at the intersection of health, technology, and social impact.
My time at Rula reaffirmed that conviction. Helping expand access to mental health care showed me just how powerful it can be to build teams around meaningful, purpose-led work.

Continuing in that spirit, I'm excited to share that I've joined Rad AI as a Senior Recruiter!

Rad AI is using generative AI to help radiologists work more efficiently, reduce burnout, and ultimately deliver better patient care. It's thoughtful, high-impact work‚Äîand I'm honored to be part of the team helping to scale it.
We're growing fast, and I'm hiring for:
üß† Senior ML Research Scientists
üíª Software Engineering Interns (Summer 2025)
If you're excited about building at the intersection of healthcare and AI, let's connect."""
