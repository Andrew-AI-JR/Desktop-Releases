At one of our customer sites, we've begun embedding Generative AI and agentic tools within Oracle Recruiting Cloud (ORC) to eliminate repetitive tasks and streamline the end-to-end hiring journey.

From auto-generating job descriptions and emails to screening candidates, these smart tools are helping recruiters reclaim their time for more strategic, human-centric work.

Generative AI isn't replacing recruiters - it's amplifying them.

Next Up: leveraging AI Agent Studio to develop more tailored and personalized solutions.

If you're working with ORC or leading a TA transformation, now's the time to explore what embedded AI + SaaS-native platforms can do. The tools are ready-and the results are real."""
